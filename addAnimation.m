function addAnimation(gltf,samplers,channels,varargin)
    % Add an animation to the mode.
    %
    % ADDANIMATION(GLTF,SAMPLERS,CHANNELS) adds an animation to GLTF, where
    % SAMPLERS is an array of animation samplers, and CHANNELS is an array
    % of animation channels.
    %
    % ADDANIMATIONSAMPLER(...,'name',NAME) sets the name of the animation,
    % that is used when triggering animations.
