function addMorphTarget(gltf,mesh_idx,V,varargin)
    % Add a target for morphing animation.
    %
    % ADDMORPHTARGET(GLTF,MESH_IDX,V) adds a morph target to the first
    % primitive in the mesh specified by MESH_IDX, with vertices specified
    % by V. V is an Nx3 array of XYZ vectors.
    %
    % ADDMORPHTARGET(...,'NORMAL',N) adds N as the vertex normals for the
    % mesh. N is an Nx3 array of XYZ vectors.
    %
    % ADDMORPHTARGET(...,'TANGENT',T) adds T as the vertex tangents for the
    % mesh. T is an Nx3 array of XYZW vectors, where W specifies the
    % handedness of the coordinate system used (+1 for NTB frame, -1 for
    % TNB frame).
    %
    % ADDMORPHTARGET(...,'weight',W) specifies the morph weight for the
    % traget. The default weight is 0.
