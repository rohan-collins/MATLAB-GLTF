function channelstruct=addAnimationChannel(~,sampler,target_node,target_path)
    % Add an animation channel.
    %
    % ADDANIMATIONCHANNEL(GLTF,SAMPLER,TARGET_NODE,TARGET_PATH) creates and
    % returns an animation channel for GLTF, with SAMPLER as the sampler
    % index, TARGET_NODE as the index of the node to be animated, and
    % TARGET_PATH as the property to be animated. In general, the sampler
    % index needs to be calculated before constructing the channel, and
    % needs to be calculated as the zero-based array index of the sampler
    % when passed to ADDANIMATION. TARGET_PATH needs to be one of
    % "translation", "rotation", "scale", or "weights".
