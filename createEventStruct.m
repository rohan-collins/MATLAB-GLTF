function eventStruct=createEventStruct(~,emitter,action,varargin)
    % Create and return an event struct for an emitter to be used in an
    % animation.
    %
    % ADDEMITTER(GLTF,EMITTER,ACTION) returns an event struct for an
    % EMITTER to take action ACTION.
    %
    % ADDEMITTER(...,'delay',TIME), delays the action by TIME seconds.
    %
    % ADDEMITTER(...,'startOffset',OFFSET) positions the clip head at a
    % specific time in seconds. This setting nly used when ACTION is
    % "play".
