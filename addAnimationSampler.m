function samplerstruct=addAnimationSampler(~,input,output,varargin)
    % Add an animation sampler.
    %
    % ADDANIMATIONSAMPLER(GLTF,INPUT,OUTPUT) creates and returns an
    % animation sampler for GLTF, with INPUT as the accessor index for the
    % input data, and OUTPUT as the accessor index for the output data. The
    % returned struct needs to be added to the animation using
    % ADDANIMATION, and hence the sampler index is not returned. It needs
    % to be calculated manually as the zero-based array index of the
    % sampler when passed to ADDANIMATION.
    %
    % ADDANIMATIONSAMPLER(...,'interpolation',METHOD) sets the
    % interpolation method to be used by the sampler. When specified,
    % METHOD needs to be one of "LINEAR", "STEP", or "CUBICSPLINE".
