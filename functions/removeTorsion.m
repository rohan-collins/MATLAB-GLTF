function [P,Q]=removeTorsion(N,B,t,s,dsdt,torsion,closed,stable)
    % Rotate the normal vectors N and binormal vector B within their plane
    % to minimise the torsion in the TNB frame.
    % [P,Q]=REMOVETORSION(N,B,S,TORSION,T,DSDT,closed,stable) returns
    % orthogonal vectors P and Q, in the same plane as normal vector N and
    % binormal vector B, such that the torsion between consecutive TNB
    % frames is minimised. It uses the cumulative curve length S, the curve
    % speed DSDT, and the TORSION. If CLOSED is true, the angle between the
    % first and the last frames is spread along the length of the curve so
    % that the first and last TPQ frames match with minimum torsion. If
    % stable is TRUE, the TPQ frames are calculated in a slower but
    % numerically stable fashion instead of algebraically.
